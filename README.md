# unit-4-game
Crystal Collector!

Instructions

You will be given a random number at the start of the game from 19-120.

There are four crystals below. Each crystal will have a random hidden value between 1-12. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your counter. 

You win the game and get a gold star by making your counter equal the random number. You lose the game and have to try again when your counter goes above the random number.
       
Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
